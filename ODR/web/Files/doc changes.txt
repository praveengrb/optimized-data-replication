Dillirani - vulnerability

Chandra- metro system
---------- Forwarded message ----------


For diilirani project:
Requirements are :1) need to change the block diagram for phase 1 and phase 2
                               2)they asked not to proceed with NN algorithm in phase 2, but they asking for enhanced detail implementation
                               3)from the block diagram why classification algorithm is used
                               4) objective is not explained
For Chandrakala project( i have to explain the same paper 2mrw sir....but u please send the papers on other domain..i have to make sure with my guide)
Requirements are :1) objective is not explained
                               2) need to change the block diagram for phase 1 and phase 2
                               3) need architecture diagram(should not be the same as base paper)
                               4)what are all the inputs and output.
                                5) what are the algorithms used
                                6) what are the columns that dataset contains
Sir,we have redo review on 2mrw...So please send the documents tonight..
