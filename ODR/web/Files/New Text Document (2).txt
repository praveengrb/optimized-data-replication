Cognitive.cc is the only fully written code.
Just Like, in which file, they added the written code,
Just Like, in which location of the program, they update the written code.

Please, Copy and put this in the MS Word file. So, only it will be clear for me to know.

                     -  First write the file location in MS Word, in which they modified
                     -  Then, Copy the program in MS Word, and highlight the text (in which they  modified)
                       
d: 3
In Graph files, what is the link between values of graph and main program coding?

There is one major coding to create '. dat' file values by main program coding.

From which location, the code will be found. I need that coding to be highlighted, mam.

This doubts are more important to know about the project, mam.

Thanking you,




Doubt 1 and 2 is answer will send on monday mam


d-3:

yes the link is occur for main code(Cognitive.cc) by using this file value graph file is generated.


If you run the cognetive.cc then that file was generating the throughput,loss,delay,pdr value. In this value can be typed in data file.

All the code in cognetive.cc(refer top to bottom all of the line was integrating to generate the value because in this file contain crete node , configure protocol and then getting the output like values of graph )
